Description: A package of functions for calculating Upper Confidence Limits (UCLs) of the mean.
 Developed primarily for environmental datasets and strongly based off of U.S. EPA's
 ProUCL software package. Calculates a number of different UCLs and makes basics recommendations
 on which UCL to use based on dataset characteristics. Also helps to format data from U.S. EPA's
 AQS database for easier use in R.
